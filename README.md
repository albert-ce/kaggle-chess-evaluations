# ***Kaggle***: Chess Evaluations

<small>*This repository is submitted as an assignment for the Machine Learning subject in the Computer Engineering degree at the Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona (UAB).* </small> 

## Project Description 
This notebook aims to estimate the **evaluation score of a chess position**, generated by Stockfish 11.0, using only **feature extraction** and **simple regression techniques**.
